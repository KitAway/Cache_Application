This repository contains a set of C++ classes that can be used to implement inline caches for the input and output global array arguments (i.e. those mapped to external DRAM) of accelerators implemented on FPGAs via high-level synthesis.
The caches, their usage and the corresponding results have been published in <insert citation when ready>.
Main sub-directories:
  cache: header files declaring and defining the cache classes and their operators and methods.
  bitonic_sort, lucas_kanade, matrix_mul, smith_wat: a set of applications (described in the paper above) that demostrate the use of the caches. Each directory contains the source code for the application, as well as three sub-directories with the Makefiles (for sdaccel) that enable the compilation, synthesis and simulation of each application with three different memory architectures 9as discussed in the paper):
    global_mem: arrays are directly mapped to global memory without cache (worst performance, best resource usage)
    local_mem: arrays are mapped to on-chip memory (unrealistic, since on-chip memory is not large enough; best performance, worst resource usage)
    cache_mem: arrays are mapped to global memory and use our caches (good performance, good area)
